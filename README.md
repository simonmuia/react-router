# React Router Demonstrated

- This project demonstrates use of React Router Library

## Course Outline

1. Basics of React Router DOM
2. Router Components:
   a. BrowserRouter - A `<BrowserRouter>` stores the current location in the browser's address bar using clean URLs and navigates using the browser's built-in history stack.
   b. HashRouter - `<HashRouter>` is for use in web browsers when the URL should not (or cannot) be sent to the server for some reason.
   c. MemoryRouter - A `<MemoryRouter>` stores its locations internally in an array. Unlike `<BrowserHistory>` and `<HashHistory>`, it isn't tied to an external source, like the history stack in a browser. This makes it ideal for scenarios where you need complete control over the history stack, like testing.
   d. NativeRouter - `<NativeRouter>` is the recommended interface for running React Router in a React Native app.

   e. Router - `<Router>` is the low-level interface that is shared by all router components (like `<BrowserRouter>` and `<StaticRouter>`). In terms of React, `<Router>` is a context provider that supplies routing information to the rest of the app.

   f. StaticRouter - `<StaticRouter>` is used to render a React Router web app in node. Provide the current location via the location prop.

3. Nested Routes - 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
